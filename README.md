# Vulnerability-Scanning-Homelab-with-Nessus

## Summary
This repository demonstrates setting up a home lab environment and executing vulnerability scanning on a vulnerable virtual machine. This project was created by using Nessus documentation found in the [Tenable documentation page](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/CredentialedChecksOnWindows.htm#Configure-a-Local-Account) and other free tools linked below.

## Walkthrough

### Preparation:
1. Download VMware Workstation 17 for Windows.
    - [VMWare Workstation download](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
    - 
2. Download the Windows 10 ISO file.
    - [Windows 10 ISO download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
3. Download and install Nessus on the host machine.

### Create Virtual Machine (VM):
1. Run the Windows.exe file and select ISO file option, then save it to the PC.
2. Use VMware Workstation to create a new VM using the Windows ISO.
    - Allocate 4096 MB RAM, 4 processors, and a bridged network connection to the VM. (less can work - this is what I used.)
3. Finish installing Windows on the VM.

### Configure Nessus:
1. Launch Nessus, sign in, and create a basic scan by entering the IP address.
2. In Discovery settings, change to all ports and save the scan.

### Run Initial Scan:
1. Launch the scan and wait for it to finish, observing results as they appear.
2. Review the initial scan results.

### Prepare VM for Credentialed Scan:
1. Open services.msc on the VM and enable the Remote Registry service.
2. In Registry Editor, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System and create a DWORD value called **LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy.**
   - Set its value to 1, and reset the VM.

### Run Credentialed Scan:
1. Add VM credentials to the existing Nessus scan and save the settings.
2. Run the scan again to include credentialed checks.

### Review Scan Results:
1. Analyze the results of the credentialed scan.
2. Check the Recommendations tab in Nessus for remediation actions.

### Perform Remediation:
1. Follow the recommended steps to remediate critical vulnerabilities, such as uninstalling outdated software and applying Windows updates.
2. Run updates on the VM until it's fully up to date, including third-party software.
     - in this case, Edge, snipping tool and microsoft office 365 all need to be updated or uninstalled. 

### Final Scan and Review:
1. Run additional scans as needed to ensure all critical vulnerabilities have been remediated.
2. Review the scan results as demonstrated above to confirm successful remediation.
